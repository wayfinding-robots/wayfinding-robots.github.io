# Robotic Wayfinding Library

The purpose of this website is twofold. Specifically, for:
1) hosting the website and raw data analysis for the literature review `Beyond Canes and Guide Dogs: The Status of Robotic Solutions for Wayfinding,
Navigating, and Orienting the Visually Impaired`
2) tracking both historical and contemporary advances in the fields of robotic wayfinding for people with visual impairments, low vision, and/or blindness (PwVI), including quadrupeds, wearables (e.g., headsets, AR glases, haptic belts), augmented canes, wheeled robots, ball bots, and more.
