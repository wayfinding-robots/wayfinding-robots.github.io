We found that specific database features are streets, sidewalks, crosswalks, and intersections and that guidance functions consist of a combination of orientation and localization, goal location, intersection, crosswalks, and warning information as well as of progression, crossing, orientation, and route-ending instructions; they have to be provided between 5 to 10 meters before an intersection, after crossing, at middle block, and after entering a street. Last, verbal guidance is possible in simple and structured urban areas, with no localization aid, and is optimal within 5 meters' precision. The outcomes and limits of the requirements of the navigational aid evidenced are discussed. }
